This repo contains a 3D-printable case for one of those "lillypad" CR2032-battery-holders-with-switch.  The board drops into the case, the switch/battery facing downwards, and the lever allows the switch to be thrown while the board is inside the case.  A push-on cap goes on top.  The intention is that the lid, and possibly the case, is modified for whatever application the board is to be put to.
